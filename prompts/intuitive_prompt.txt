Consider the following setting as a graph. 
In your response do not visually draw the graph. 
To determine if there is a series of flights that goes from the starting city to the destination city using topological order, first, represent the given flights as a directed graph and then perform a topological sorting to see if there exists a valid sequence of flights from the starting city and destination city.
List all the flights and the topological order to help determine if there is a series of flights from the starting and destination city. Start from the starting city in the topological order. 
Check if there's a flight from that city to any city in the list that comes after the starting city. If such a flight exists, follow the flight and update your current city to the destination city. 
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the destination city or there are no more flights available. So we see that if we cannot reach the destination city starting from the starting city while following the given flights, there is no successful series of flights.

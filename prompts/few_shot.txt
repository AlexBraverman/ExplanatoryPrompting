User: 'Question : Consider the following setting as a graph. In your response do not visually draw the graph. Current flight information (the following flights are one-way only, and all the flights available are included below): There is a flight from city A to city E There is a flight from city B to city I There is a flight from city J to city C There is a flight from city J to city D There is a flight from city B to city A There is a flight from city L to city F There is a flight from city I to city M There is a flight from city H to city J There is a flight from city A to city G There is a flight from city L to city K There is a flight from city I to city N There is a flight from city H to city L Then using the topological order, answer the question. Is there a series of flights that goes from city H to city M?' ChatGPT: To determine if there is a series of flights that goes from city H to city M using topological order, we can follow a similar approach as before. First, represent the given flights as a directed graph and then perform a topological sorting to see if there exists a valid sequence of flights from city H to city M. Given flights: A -> E B -> I J -> C J -> D B -> A L -> F I -> M H -> J A -> G L -> K I -> N H -> L Topological order: H, B, J, A, H, L, C, D, E, G, I, K, F, N, M To determine if there is a series of flights from city H to city M: Start from city H in the topological order. Check if there's a flight from city H to any city in the list that comes after city H. If such a flight exists, follow the flight and update your current city to the destination city. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach city M or there are no more flights available. Following this process, we find: Start at H. There is a flight from H to J. Move to J. There is a flight from J to C. Move to C. There is no flight from C to M. Now we can go back to H to see if there is any other possible paths, the only other flight from H is to L. Now we see from L, the only flights leaving L are to F and K. To make sure no series of flights exists from H to M, we must make sure these paths do not connect to M. From F there is no flights leaving, meaning F is a deadend. Since L is the only other city left, and it is also a deadend with no flights leaving it, we can confidently conclude that there is path from H to M. So we see that Since we cannot reach city M starting from city H while following the given flights, there is no series of flights that goes from city H to city M in this scenario.'
